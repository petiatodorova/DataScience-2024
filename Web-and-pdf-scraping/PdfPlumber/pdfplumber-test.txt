The private aviation landscape
New private aviation models, and changes
in how traditional models are delivered,
are shaping the current landscape
There appears to be a move away from ownership, as alternative
offerings become more attractive and flying without owning becomes
easier. Other modes of private aviation include on-demand chartering,
membership programs (‘jetcards’) and fractional ownership; with
many companies offering either a single service or a range.

PROFILING TODAY’S ULTRA WEALTHY FLIERS
The private
aircraft owners
Full aircraft ownership is an option
for the very wealthiest UHNWIs
Private aircraft ownership is hugely expensive, with just the upfront
cost of a jet in the tens of millions of dollars. For instance, an eight-seater
Cessna Citation XLS costs approximately $14m4 with longer-range
jets much more expensive; a Falcon 2000DX costs around $42m.5
Further maintenance costs push it out of reach for the typical UHNW
individual. So unsurprisingly, those who own them are typically the
wealthiest of the wealthy, with an average net worth of $1.5bn. More
than one in three (35%) private jet owners are worth more than $500m.
They are also typically older, male, and married. The majority of
owners are over 60 and have created some or all the wealth themselves
(91% wholly or partly self-made). Age and higher wealth levels are
testament to the nature of wealth creation, demonstrating how
extreme wealth takes time to generate.
Public holdings make up the largest asset allocation of owners; these
individuals typically own a share of the public companies that helped
create their wealth, having been an executive or founder. Furthermore,
nearly 20% of these individuals are in the finance, banking and investment
industry – compared with the global average of 14.5%. Finance is a key
global industry of the wealthy but the over representation within this
group and the large proportion of wealth in public holdings suggest that
an increased interest in the stock market and private investment may
prompt an increased need to fly privately.
Philanthropy ranks as the most common interest among owners, with
nearly half of them engaged in benevolent causes. This is significantly
higher than the global UHNW individual average of 36.3%, as
4 Private Fly accessed Dec 2017 philanthropy is typically more predominant at higher wealth levels.

Members of private
aviation programs
Membership programs appeal widely
to owners and non-owners alike
This group is also significantly wealthier than the typical UHNWI,
with one in four (28%) having more than $500m in net worth. Its
popularity is high for individuals who fly frequently, as membership
programs tend to be better suited to this compared with on-demand
chartering and commercial flights.
Interestingly, over half of owners also use membership programs
because, on many occasions, they can be more efficient than using
their own aircraft for certain types of flight. For example, their own
aircraft might be unavailable due to maintenance, they may need
to travel to destinations where their personal pilot or aircraft are
not permitted to go and their flight may require a different, more
appropriate type of aircraft (e.g. larger or smaller).
A great deal of program members created their wealth partly or fully
by themselves (91%). Their wealth is, on average, mostly in private
holdings at 39%. This indicates that the average individual owns a
private company, and may be using membership programs in their
name but on behalf of the company.
Financial services are the most significant industry for the group,
with finance, banking and investment the major business activities for
21% of these individuals, making up three times the share of the next
biggest industry (industrial conglomerates). Compared with owners,
6% of this audience are primarily associated with the tech industry,
reinforcing the slightly younger profile of program members.
For program members, sports beat philanthropy for the most
common passion/interest at 41%.

Using qualitative interviews carried out with independent experts and
published information from leading providers in each field, Wealth-X has
objectively assessed how well each solution performs against the established
needs of frequent private fliers. Of course, this is an approach that can, to
some extent, mask the variability within each area – one charter experience,
for example, may not be like another. However, at a high level, this index
provides a way to navigate and compare different flying options from the
perspective of the fliers.
